# Meme Downloader 2016

That name is just joking :)

This app downloads can download stuff from a subreddit of your choice(feature pending) and throws what it gets into a folder.

This app runs 64 threads, and is (sometimes) VERY resource hungry on memory, some processes might stay as zombies, that means, they don't die, examples are ffmpeg, that can prevent you from deleting the program
