# Meme Downloader 2016

That name is just joking :)

Dependencies (handled by the program by the most part):

  - ffmpeg
  - ~~youtube-dlp~~ (soon)

This app downloads can download stuff from a subreddit of your choice and throws what it gets into a folder.

This app runs 32 threads by default, and is (sometimes) VERY resource hungry on memory, some processes might stay as zombies, that means, they don't die, examples are ffmpeg, that can prevent you from deleting the program 

**This app has some dependencies on Windows**

How to make `config.josn`?

This is the default `config.json` configuration:

```
{
	"TargetSubReddit0": "shitposting",
	"TargetSubReddit1": "dankmemes",
	"TargetSubReddit2": "memes",
	"TargetSubReddit3": "crappyoffbrands",
	"TargetSubReddit4": "nocontextpics",
	"MaxRepeatTimes": 10000,
	"SimultaneousDownload": true,
	"ThreadCount": 32
}
```
**TargetSubreddit(0, 1, 2, 3)**: This are the subreddits from where you want to get posts from <br>
**MaxTimesRepeated**: This is the max amount of times the bot has to get a "It already exists" to change and download from another subreddit<br>
**SimultaneousDownload**: This enables the program to download from two subreddits simultaneously<br>
**ThreadCount**: This is how many bots will run simultaneously, going over 32 is normally overkill

------------------

### **NOTES**:

 - After downloading dependencies the program will fail to run the bots, close and open again the program for it to work as intended
